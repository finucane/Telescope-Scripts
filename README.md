Telescope-Scripts are a bunch of python scripts I wrote for my father, who is an engineer working on the Giant Magellan Telescope project.

They are the first tools I wrote in python, learning the language and also some 3rd party frameworks along the way. They pull in historical meteorological data from a server and make graphs from the data using 3rd party math, calendar, and plotting modules.

There's some non-trivial code in "ambient.py" that matches up data from different sensors even though none of the time-stamps match exactly.
